# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## Getting Started
* To use Twitter's data, you'll have to create an application using your twitter's developer account (apps.twitter.com). 
* Copy your application keys and tokens(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token and access_token_secret) and paste them into the script.

## Output
It prints out series of tweets and with that its sentiment analysis. The important thing to note here is, Polarity indicates how positive or negative the tweet is ( -1 < sentiment < 1) and subjectivity measure how much of a personal opinion is there in the text.
